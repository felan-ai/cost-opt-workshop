# Felan Workshop Flow

## 1. Configure the baseline agent

Before starting the baseline implementation, configure Felan with the optimization extensions disabled:

```json
{
  "builtinExtensions": {
    "prewalk": false,
    "rtkOptimizer": false,
    "codebaseMemory": false,
    "markitdown": false
  }
}
```

Keep the normal coding-agent capabilities, including subagents, browser, tasks, and background commands, at their default settings. The goal is to disable the four optimization extensions, not to remove the agent's ordinary implementation and verification tools.

For the workshop baseline used with Felan:

```json
{
  "defaultModel": "gpt-6-astra",
  "defaultThinkingLevel": "high"
}
```

After changing the configuration, exit any existing Felan session. Start the baseline session only after creating the baseline worktree below.

## 2. Open the prepared baseline worktree

The baseline and enhanced worktrees should already exist from the pre-workshop setup. Enter the baseline worktree before starting the implementation session:

```bash
cd path/to/cost-opt-workshop-baseline
```
